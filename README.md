# dathttpd

A Web server for [Dat](https://datprotocol.com) and HTTPS.

Dat sites are hosted at public keys, which are the equivalent of IP addresses in the P2P network. The pubkeys are ugly, though! Wouldn't it be nice if your dats could have nice DNS shortnames, and also rehost over HTTPS for people still on legacy browsers?

dathttpd is for you!

 - Serve sites over Dat at `dat://{subdomain}.{yourdomain.com}`.
 - Rehost those sites over `https://{subdomain}.{yourdomain.com}`.
 - Get TLS certs automatically with Let's Encrypt.
 - (Optionally) Auto-redirect from https -> dat.

## Getting started

### Start hosting your website with Dat

You can use the [Dat CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dat) or the [Beaker
Browser](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker).

After uploading your site to a Dat archive, identify the archive's URL. You'll
need this for your dathttpd config.

### Update your DNS records

Create an A record that points to your server's IP address.

## Usage

On your server, create a config file at `~/.dathttpd.yml`:

```yaml
letsencrypt:
  email: 'bob@foo.com'
  agreeTos: true
sites:
  dat.local:
    url: dat://1f968afe867f06b0d344c11efc23591c7f8c5fb3b4ac938d6000f330f6ee2a03/
    datOnly: false
  datprotocol.dat.local:
    url: dat://ff34725120b2f3c5bd5028e4f61d14a45a22af48a7b12126d5d588becde88a93/
    datOnly: true
```

Then run

```
# install build dependencies
sudo apt-get install libtool m4 automake

# install dathttpd (https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions)
npm install -g dathttpd

# give node perms to use ports 80 and 443
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep `readlink -f \`which node\``

# start dathttpd
dathttpd
```

To daemonify the server in Debian-based systems, stop the dathttpd process and
then run:

```
# install a helper tool
npm install -g add-to-systemd

# create a systemd entry for dathttpd
sudo add-to-systemd dathttpd --user $(whoami) $(which dathttpd)

# start the dathttpd service
sudo systemctl start dathttpd
```

## Config

Here's an example `~/.dathttpd.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  http: 80
  https: 443
  metric: 8089
directory: ~/.dathttpd
letsencrypt:
  email: 'bob@foo.com'
  agreeTos: true
sites:
  dat.local:
    url: dat://1f968afe867f06b0d344c11efc23591c7f8c5fb3b4ac938d6000f330f6ee2a03/
    datOnly: false
  datprotocol.dat.local:
    url: dat://ff34725120b2f3c5bd5028e4f61d14a45a22af48a7b12126d5d588becde88a93/
    datOnly: true
```

### ports.http

The port to serve the HTTP sites. Defaults to 80. (Optional)

HTTP automatically redirects to HTTPS.

### ports.https

The port to serve the HTTPS sites. Defaults to 443. (Optional)

### directory

The directory where dathttpd will store your Dat archive's files. Defaults to ~/.dathttpd. (Optional)

### letsencrypt

Settings for LetsEncrypt. If false or unset, HTTPS will be disabled.

### letsencrypt.email

The email to send Lets Encrypt? notices to. (Required)

### letsencrypt.agreeTos

Do you agree to the terms of service of Lets Encrypt? (Required, must be true)

### sites

A listing of the sites to host. Each site is labeled (keyed) by the hostname you want the site to serve at.

You'll need to configure the DNS entry for the hostname to point to the server. For instance, if using `portal.myhostname.com`, you'll need a DNS entry pointing `portal.myhostname.com` to the server.

### sites.{hostname}.url

The Dat URL of the site to host. (Required)

### sites.{hostname}.datOnly

If true, rather than serve the assets over HTTPS, dathttpd will serve a redirect to the dat:// location. Defaults to false. (Optional)

## Env Vars

  - `DATHTTPD_CONFIG=cfg_file_path` specify an alternative path to the config than `~/.dathttpd.yml`
  - `NODE_ENV=debug|staging|production` set to `debug` or `staging` to use the lets-encrypt testing servers.

## Metrics

dathttpd have built-in support for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). The metric is exposed at `http://::8089` by default.

Currently we have only one metric:

* `app_https_hits{hostname}` : total https requests served since server restart.
